Android ndk implementation of magnetic field switch

This is an implementation of the Android NDK accelerator and magnetic-field sensors to detect a magnetic switch like this one from Google Cardboard.

The callback function is a simple algorithm to track the magnetic field switch. Feel free to provide your own.
